Arrow Functions provide two main benefits or features compared to regular function definitions: more concise syntax, and lexical scoping of "this". Let's take a quick look at both.

## Arrow Function Syntax

Arrow functions provide a more concise way to define functions. Arrow functions are especially useful when declaring a callback function. Take a look at the following comparison:

```javascript
// Traditional function definition
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("I will print after 100ms");
}, 100);

// Arrow function definition
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("I will also print after 100ms");
}, 100);
```

### Syntax variations:

Depending on the number of arguments and the content of the function, arrow functions can be declared in several ways:

```javascript
// No arguments
const func = () => {
  // function body
};

// One argument - no parenthesis are needed for one argument
const func = x => {
  // function body
};

// Two arguments - parenthesis are needed
const func = (x, y) => {
  // function body
};

// Implicit return
const func = (x, y) => x + y;
```

### Implicit returns

Note the last version in the above code block. If an arrow function contains a single expression, you can exclude curly braces and a return statement. To better understand this, it's important to understand the difference between an "Expression" and a "Statement".

<br />

In basic terms, an "Expression" resolves to a value, e.g. 3 + 4. A "Statement" is a set of instructions, e.g. `document.querySelector('.list').innerHTML = "Hello world"`.

<br />

If an arrow function only contains a single expression, we can omit the **return** keyword. This is particularly useful in simple callbacks, for instance in a map or filter function:

```javascript
const array = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// Arrow function
const doubledArray = array.map(item => item * 2);

// Traditional function
const doubledArray = array.map(function (item) {
  return item * 2;
});
```

## Lexical scoping

Arrow functions also affect how the **this** keyword works, more specifically what it refers to.

### What is this?

Simply put, **this** refers to the object that is executing a function. Think about the various ways you can declare a function in JavaScript (before Arrow Functions):

#### Regular function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}
```

#### Object methods:

```javascript
const cat = {
  name: "Todd",
  age: 1,
  speak: function () {
    console.log("Meow");
  },
};
```

#### Constructors:

```javascript
function Cat(name, age) {
  this.name = name; // notice we're referencing this
  this.age = age;
}

const oscar = new Cat("Oscar", 1);
```

Provided you are not running JavaScript in 'strict' mode, **this** will have a value in each of the above functions.

#### Regular functions:

**This** refers to the global object, which in the browser refers to the _window_, and in Node refers to _global_ (Note: Deno's global object is also called 'Window')

#### Object methods:

**This** in an object method refers to the object itself:

```javascript
const milly = {
  name: "Milly",
  age: 15,
  printDetails: function () {
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old`); // Outputs: 'Milly is 15 years old'
  },
};
```

#### Constructors:

Since a constructor is called using the **new** keyword, this refers to the instance of the object being created by the constructor (Note: calling a constructor without the **new** keyword returns undefined). See the example above for usage of **this** in a constructor.

### How arrow functions affect "this"

The simplest way to explain the difference between **this** in regular functions and arrow functions is that: in a regular function, **this** refers to the object that _called_ the function; whereas in an arrow function, **this** refers to the object that the _defined_ the function. Consider the following examples:

#### Arrow function declared at the top level:

```javascript
const topLevelArrow = () => {
  console.log(this); // Output: Global object
};
```

nothing new there.

<br />

#### Object methods:

```javascript
const milly = {
  name: "Milly",
  age: 15,
  printDetails: () => {
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old`); // Output: 'undefined is undefined years old'
  },
};
```

So what's the difference here? When you declared the object, the object is _defined_ in the global object (you can easily test this by console logging the global **this**. You should be able to see the object you created as a property of the global object). Declaring a function as a method of your object means that you are defining the function in the global object. It would be the same as doing this:

```javascript
function meow() {
  console.log(`${this.name} meowed`);
}

const todd = {
  name: "Todd",
  makeSound: meow,
};

todd.makeSound(); // Output: 'Todd meowed'
```

Because you used a regular function definition, even though the "meow" function was declared completely separately from the "todd" object, **this** still references "todd" because that's the object that called the "meow" function.

But as mentioned before, **this** in an arrow function refers to the object that defined the function, which as also mentioned above is the global object. Since the "name" and "age" properties are properties of the "todd" object, not the global object, when referencing "this.name" or "this.age" in an arrow function, **this** doesn't have those properties defined on it, because **this** is the global object.

## Conclusion

Which function type is better to use? In a lot of cases, that comes down to ascetics; which syntax you prefer. But it's important to know the difference in scoping, because in some cases, because of the way each function deals with **this**, you would need to use one instead of the other (Note: there are other ways around lexical scoping, like using .bind()). So pick the best tool for the job.
