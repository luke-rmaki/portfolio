Hi. I'm Luke. I build websites and webapps using a varied tool box. My primary tool of choice is **_JavaScript_**. I'm equally at home writing a Node application, scripting a serverless function, or crafting a UI.

<br />

I love to problem solve; whether that's finding a solution to a client's problem (e.g how to sell their goods or services), or finding a solution to problems in code. I enjoy creating elegant solutions to complicated problems.

<br />

While I work primarily in **_JavaScript_**, one of the things I love about the web is how fast moving it is; there's always something new to learn. I cut my teeth programming with **_Python_**. I've also worked with **_PHP_** and **_Wordpress_**, both by myself and on a team.

## Some tech I've worked with:

**_Javascript_**:

- React
- Node and Express
- Svelte
- Gatsby (what this site is built with)

<br />

**_PHP_**:

- Wordpress
