Hi, I'm <mark>Luke</mark>.

<Image />

> I have more hobbies and interests than time available to do them all. Primary, I love writing code and using Web Technologies. I built this site with **[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)** and **[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)**, but have been contemplating rewriting it with **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**. There are just so many exciting new technologies to try 😍!

> In my day job, I work for [Serco ASPAC](https://www.serco.com/aspac) as a Reporting Analyst and Real Time Manager. If there is a repetative task in my job, it must be automated 😆.

> If I had to pick some hobbies and interests to list, then these would be it: coding (obviously), music (I play the guitar and piano), and reading/listening to books about space exploration, astronomy, history, economics, and pyschology.
